# [Code a React App With the WordPress REST API][published url]
## Instructor: [Jeremy McPeak][instructor url]


WordPress is a time-tested and easy to use CMS that powers a big fraction of the world's websites. React is a cutting edge front-end web framework that makes it easy to deliver up-to-date user experiences. Now, with the WordPress REST API, you can combine the two for the best of both worlds: the features and simplicity of the WordPress CMS and the modern responsive UI of a React app.

In this course, Envato Tuts+ instructor Jeremy McPeak will teach you how to build a React front-end for WordPress. This app will use the WordPress REST API to fetch page data, authenticate users and perform other administrative tasks. You'll see how to add navigation with React Router and how to filter and retrieve posts by category.
